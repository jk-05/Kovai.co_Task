    "KEY DATA INSIGHTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NETWORK BACKBONE: The 'Rapid Route' is the dominant carrier.\n",
    "   - It accounts for 39.1% of all traffic, making it critical for infrastructure investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WEEKEND EFFICIENCY: Ridership drops significantly on weekends.\n",
    "   - Rapid Route volume falls by 61.8% on weekends compared to weekdays.\n",
    "   - Recommendation: Reduce weekend frequency to save operational costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SCHOOL ALLOCATION: School bus usage is strictly binary.\n",
    "   - Total ridership on weekends: 60.\n",
    "   - Insight: School assets are 100% idle on weekends and can be repurposed for events or maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. RECOVERY TREND: Strong post-pandemic rebound.\n",
    "   - Local Route ridership has grown 37.1% since 2021 averages.\n",
    "   - This signals a return to normal commuter patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SERVICE SYNERGY: Rapid Route and Light Rail are tied together.\n",
    "   - Correlation Coefficient: 0.9677 (Near perfect).\n",
    "   - Insight: When one gets busy, the other does too. They likely feed into each other or serve parallel corridors.\n",
